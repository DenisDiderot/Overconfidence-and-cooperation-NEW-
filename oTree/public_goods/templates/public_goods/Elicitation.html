    <p>
        Choose which alternative you prefere in each set, i.e. pair. An algorithm will randomly pick one pair and your payment of this stage will depend on your choice in that very one. On the left hand side you can see a lottery that gives the chance to win 100 tokens with increasing probability; if chosen, the software will randomly pick a number and pay you with the given probability. On the right hand side you can decide to compare your result with that of a randomly chosen participant. If you performed better you receive 100 credit points, otherwise he receives the tokens.

        <p> Notice that we will assume that if you accept the lottery for a certain probability, you should accept it also for higher probability.</p>
